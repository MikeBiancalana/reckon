Have the @agent-principal-engineer work off tasks from `bd` and @agent-code-reviewer check the work.
When starting on a task, pin it using `bd pin` and create a new branch off of `origin/main`. Since there are other worktrees, try not to checkout main. Call the agent fresh, starting with no residual context for each task. After the initial coding is
complete, the task is not done until the @agent-code-reviewer reviews the code and approves. Iterate between the two agents on a task as much as necessary. When the task is complete, make sure the code is checked in and a PR is created. Finally, mark the
task done in `bd`, and squash merge the PR to main. `gh` is present and works.
Continue working on tasks.
